## Road Accidents in US
1.We see that the feature wind_speed and temperature have high correlation.So if we use this dataset fr making prediction we can drop one of the feature from our machine learning model.

2.Accident data is collected from three sources namely MapQuest,Bing Source and MapQuest-Bing.Most of the data is collected from MapQuest platform.

3.Accidents are categorised into four groups (1-4) based on their Severity.1 being least and 4 being more severe.Most of the accidents(67.5%) fall in the severity category 2.

4.Most of the accidents happen on right side (82%) and remaining 18% on the right side.There is another label blank in the dataset.I guess it means blank spots on the road.

5.USA has four time zones namely Eastern,Central,Mountain and Pacific.More accidents happen in the Eastern time zone (42.3%) followed by Pacific(28%),Central(24%) and Mountain(5.7%).The percentage of accidents is correlated to the populaton density of USA.The East and the West coas has more populaton.He we can see that there are more accidents in thoe areas.

6.We can see that most of the accidents get cleared within 30 min and in sum cases accidents may take upto 6 hours to clear.

7.We can see that when we go on the state level more accidents happen in the state of California(CA),Texas(TX) and Florida(FL).South Dakota (SD),Wyoming(WY) and North Dakota(ND) have the accidents with high severity.Even though more accidents happen in the state of California we can see that more severe Accidents happen to the North Eastern States of USA
